How to play
-----------

Select a piece that you want to move. If you change your mind, you can reclick the same piece and choose another piece. Green overlay highlights the squares into which the piece can move (this includes special moves). Click a target square to move the piece into it.

When a pawn is promoted, a pop-up appears that allows you to choose the replacing piece. When a king performs castling, the affiliated rook is moved automatically.

On top of the window there is a toolbar that allows to change language, toggle spotlight, restart, load, save, or quit the game.

On bottom of the window there is status text that shows information about the current state of the game and the functions of different toolbar icons when mouse is hovered over them.

The spotlight feature highlights the pieces that can currently be moved.


How to cheat
------------

To facilitate testing, there is a debug feature that allows removing pieces by right-clicking them.
